# H5P Music Notation Question Set


This module combines all types of music notation tasks, allowing you to create a combined assignment from several assignment types without having to change the assignment.

All assignments are displayed on separate slides. 
The final assessment and scoring are cumulative.

Currently, this module incorporates the H5P modules [Musik Notation](https://github.com/H5P-MusicNotation/H5P-MusicNotation) and [Music Notation Multiple Choice](https://github.com/H5P-MusicNotation/H5P-MusicNotation-MultipleChoice). For individual documentations, please click on the module names.

You will find the h5p-file of the current version in the "h5p-package" folder.
